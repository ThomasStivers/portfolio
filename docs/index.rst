   usage

The **portfolio** tool tracks a collection of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds daily. A report can be generated in html or markdown which summarizes the performance of stocks held in the portfolio.

* The value of all held shares
* The change in value from the previous day
* The change as a percentage
* The ranking for the reported change for the year
* the ranking of the overall value for the year

The above elements are also reported for each holding separately.
